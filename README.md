### Inspiration:

It is no doubt that the ongoing pandemic has shattered our day-to-day lifestyle, staggered our economy and made us fear social interactions crippling our personal development and evolution. Seeing the effects of COVID-19 we wanted to provide a service, a relief for the common man depending on public transportation and city navigation.

### Solution:

Our web application - MapSense makes it easy for users of New York City (hoping to expand to other major cities around the world) to safely navigate through the Village avoiding unnecessary dangers and infectious interactions, by visualizing relevant data provided by NYCHealth and NYPD.

We have mined and analyzed more than 1000 data points from the past year, manually removing discrepancies and errors. We then visualized the data with distinct and colorful icons using Python and Google Maps JavaScript API allowing the user to customize their search on the go, while receiving the most recent data from reliable sources.

### Purpose:

MapSense is a versatile application providing users with useful information all in one place, and its use is only limited to individual needs. We are hoping to help the people of New York City navigate safely in the concrete jungle by raising awareness of potential risks and dangers. Maybe our client wishes to purchase or rent an apartment/house and is deciding on which neighborhood to settle in? Maybe our client is a tourist unfamiliar with the city's busy life and is hoping to take a bite of the Big Apple? Maybe our client depends on our service to navigate through unfamilliar streets of New York to get to their destination? In any case MapSense's features can be tailored to each user's needs only limited to their goals and destinations.

### What's next for MapSense:

Because the map depends on data made available by each city we are hoping to establish partnerships with government officials operating in the area. We have narrowed our focus on New York City for demonstration purposes but are looking to expand to other major cities all over the world. New features will include even more datasets and a news-source parsing algorithm to warn our users of the arising dangers.
